# fmx.6.decompiler
Decompiler for Oracle FMX files version 6

It is an old research project to rescue Forms.6 applications. It doesn't work with all functionalities of FMX.6 files. No time at the moment to enhance it.

You have to compile it with JDK 1.8.

Start with `info/phosco/forms/viewer/tabbed/Desktop.java` (graphical UI) or `info/phosco/forms/translate/OracleHacker.java` (command-line).
